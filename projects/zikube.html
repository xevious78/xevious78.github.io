                <h2 class="subtitle norwester">The Scope</h2>

                <p>I was given 2 months to come up with a brand new concept of device that could help people suffering from the <b>Huntington's Disease</b> interact and communicate with their family and their friends.</p>
                <hr>
                <b>Huntington's Disease</b>

                <p>The Huntington's Disease, also called Huntington's Chorea, is a genetic disorder that leads to the death of brain cells, resulting in loss of motor and cognitive abilities. First symptoms, mostly noticeable after the age of 35, include changes in cognition skills, apparition of uncontrollable movements and memory loss.</p>

                <p>Time after time, the disease prevents the patient from being able to communicate properly with the family and the medical staff.</p>

                <h1 class="title norwester white">Music as a Starting Point</h1>

                <h2 class="subtitle norwester white">The Idea</h2>

                <p>Quite surprisingly, it appears that people suffering from Huntington's Disease are less prone to uncontrollable movements when they are <b>involved in a creative artistic activity</b>.<br>
                Being a musician and a composer, I know how music can be an interesting way to be engaged in an emotional experience, so I did my best to help them play music.</p>
                <hr>

                <p><b>However</b> music is an elitist activity as most of musical instruments require the player to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>- Precisely <b>control hands and/or air flow</b>;</li>

                    <li>- Know a bit of <b>music theory</b>.</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p>The Theremin is a very interesting instrument that uses the musician movements to create notes. The user is able to move freely around the instrument to shape the perfect sound, however, this musical device requires impressive hand-control skills. How can we improve this musical instrument ?</p>

                    <b>A new Musical Instrument</b>

                    <p>ZiKube is the next generation of Theremin and Sequencer. This instrument is shaped like a cube with each face analyzing the user movements in order to find or generate a sample that will be played and looped accordingly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="box">
                    <b>A Social Device</b>

                    <p>Music is a language meant to be shared with others, that is why I absolutely had to add a social touch in this concept. Each face of the cube is illuminated with a set of lights indicating where the other players are playing. The musician is then free to follow the band to make a sound more powerful, or to avoid them to play a softer sample.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="box">
                    <b>Without Frustration</b>

                    <p>This musical instrument also handles the music theory and knows which instruments sound great together, allowing the musician to play, compose and express her creativity without knowing anything about music.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="box">
                    <b>For Everybody</b>

                    <p>Hand movements are very personal and, in a sense, they define our personality : some of us are very calm and relaxed whereas others cannot stop moving. While regular instruments make musicians interact the same way to produce a sound, ZiKube encourages musicians to let their hands move, rest or wiggle as they wish in order to let their own personality be a part of the show.</p>
